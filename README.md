## About

This repository is a personal learning diary where I document how I’ve gained proficiency in Next.js. Each project included here is paired with explanations in the code and comments that not only demonstrate how something works—but also **why** I did it that way. Whether you're just starting out or looking to deepen your understanding, this repo offers insights into practical use-cases and decision-making in real code.

## Projects

Below are some of the projects I built as part of my Next.js learning journey:

- **acadtech**  
- **dropkit** 
- **iddeas**
- **nextfullstack** 
- **unmessage** 
- **updateformnv** 
- **videsino**

Each project folder contains annotated code, configuration notes, and sometimes additional tips or "gotchas" I ran into while learning.

Each folder corresponds to a learning project.

Inside, you'll find:

* `pages/`, `components/`, etc., as per standard Next.js project layout
* Inline comments and `README` explaining setup, logic, and learning themes.

## Learning Highlights

I started this repository as a way to document my Next.js learning process publicly. Each commit, each project, and each README update marks a new concept I've grasped or a challenge I've overcome. My goal is to not only learn Next.js but also to build a useful resource for others who are on a similar path.

Here are some of the key Next.js topics I covered and annotated:

* File-based routing — Organizing pages/ for automatic route generation
* API routes — Creating backend endpoints within Next.js
* Data fetching — Using getStaticProps, getServerSideProps, and getStaticPaths
* Client-side data fetching — Integrating SWR or useEffect hooks for fetching data dynamically
* Image optimizations — Using the <Image> component for performance benefits
* CSS modules & Tailwind — Applying styling approaches tailored to component-based design
* TypeScript integration — Typing props, API responses, and component state
* Environment variables — Managing secrets and configurations securely.
